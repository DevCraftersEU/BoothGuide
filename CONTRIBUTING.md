Thank you for your intention to contribute to BoothGuide. Currently, I (Snorzze) am the only developer of BoothGuide but I highly appreciate contributions to the project.

## Contribution Guidelines

GitHub Issues and Pull Requests are used for tracking contributions. Participants must adhere to the GitHub Community Guidelines (found at https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/).

The BoothGuide project is always looking for new contributors to work on all parts of the project. 
Every contribution is welcome and needed to make it better. A contribution can be anything from a small documentation typo fix to a new component.
