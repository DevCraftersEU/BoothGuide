# üíÅ BoothGuide

Booth guide is a simple tool to manage and display exhibitors at exhibitions and similar events.
The app (Frontend) is built with [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) + [vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) and works as an SPA /
PWA.
This means that the app can be installed on any device you like.
The data is stored in a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application (Backend) using a PostgreSQL
backend.

Once loaded, the application stores all data on the device and works completely offline.
This allows users to view all exhibitor information even in places where no internet is available.
Data is updated when the application is opened again or when manually requested.

|--------------------|----------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `SHOW_FOOTER`      | ‚úñÔ∏è       | `false` | Set to `true` if you want to enable the footer to be displayed on the front end.                                                          |
| `FOOTER_MESSAGE`   | ‚úñÔ∏è       | `---`   | The message to be displayed in the footer. If not specified, only the image will be displayed.                                            |
| `FOOTER_IMAGE_XS`  | ‚úñÔ∏è       | `---`   | The image displayed on screens with a [width of XS](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/features/display-and-platform/#breakpoints-and-thresholds).  |
| `FOOTER_IMAGE_SM`  | ‚úñÔ∏è       | `---`   | The image displayed on screens with a [width of SM](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/features/display-and-platform/#breakpoints-and-thresholds).  |
| `FOOTER_IMAGE_MD`  | ‚úñÔ∏è       | `---`   | The image displayed on screens with a [width of MD](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/features/display-and-platform/#breakpoints-and-thresholds).  |

| `FOOTER_IMAGE_XL`  | ‚úñÔ∏è       | `---`   | The image displayed on screens with a [width of XL](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/features/display-and-platform/#breakpoints-and-thresholds).  |

**Important**: If you use an image, make sure you provide at least the XS image. When the frontend requests an image, it
also sends the size of the display. The backend will then try to find the best matching image (e.g. if the screen size
is XL, the backend will test if there is an image for an XL screen. If not, it will try to get an image for an LG
screen, and so on). So by providing an image for XS screens, you will always have a fallback option.

## üåê Secure Communication

To enable secure TLS connections, a reverse proxy such as [nginx](https://nginx.org/) is recommended. The following
nginx server configuration can be used for this:

```nginx
server {
    server_name _;

    location / {
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            proxy_pass http://localhost:7000;
    }

    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;

    listen 443 ssl; 
    ssl_certificate <Path to Certificate>;
    ssl_certificate_key <Path to Key>; 
    ssl_dhparam <Path to DHParams>;

}
server {
    server_name _;
    listen 80;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;

}
```

## üî® Contribution Instructions

To contribute to this project you have to check out the repository first. To get the project running locally, follow
the steps below.

### üîå Run the Backend

Run the Spring Boot application in the backend folder with the `dev` profile. This will start the backend at
localhost on port `8080`. With the `dev` profile a local h2 in memory database will be used and the default admin
password will be set to `localTesting`.

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

### üíª Run the frontend

You will need [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to run the frontend. Other package managers should also work, but may cause
unexpected problems. To get the frontend up and running, follow the steps below. The frontend build tool used
is [vite](https://vite.dev/).

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
